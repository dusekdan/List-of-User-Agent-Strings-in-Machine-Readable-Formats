# List of User Agent Strings in Machine Readable Formats

Are you looking for an enormous list of various User Agents, which you could use for your project? Maybe even in some very specific format as array or list in your favorite programming language? Well, then you have come into the right place.

**This repository contains**:

* JSON list of User Agents (...)[githublink-placeholder]
* Python list of User Agents (...)[githublink-placeholder]
* xxx...

## How it works

There is this one awesome page, [User Agent String.com](http://useragentstring.com), which contains a huge list of various User Agents. I wrote a simple python script that will scrape the page and retrieve list of user agents, which it subsequently writes to output files as data structures in various programming languages. You can then come here, and copy paste these to your projects and simply work withe them from there.

**Possible future todos**: Output files could contain categorized data structures to enable you to choose only a specific type of user agents (for example all non-bot/non-crawler user agents).
